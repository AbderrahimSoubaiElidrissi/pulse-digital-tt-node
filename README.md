# Node.js interns technical test
Hi everyone and welcome.

Technical spec
---------------
Your application should be in Noide.js.

We believe good engineering is about using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them. 

**DO NOT USE ANY NPM PACKAGE FOR THIS TEST**

* Use node.js as runtime
* The code should be on your github account
* Use Javascript ES5 (javascript5).

Functional spec
---------------
The coding challenge is about implementing an CSV file parser. 

- The program should read the csv file 
- The program should parse the readed file to another usefull data type
- Write a small program that implement your parser (example of use)
 
How we review
----------------

Your application will be reviewed by at least two of our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

**We value quality over feature-completeness**.

The aspects of your code we will review include:

* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Version Control**: are you commiting early and often ? how good are your git commit messages ? 
* **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
